> 4 - I never forget itâ€™s on my mind all the time I just procrastinate 
> 
> 5 - I find it boring and do questions or Anki instead which isnâ€™t bad but Iâ€™ve seen my scores improving after reading FA
> 
> 6 - Iâ€™ll complete Ques and Anki before dinner and even if I donâ€™t I wonâ€™t touch them after dinner. ONLY FA AFTER DINNER.

> Sounds like after dinner isn't the best time to do this for you. Any way you can shift things around to make it easier?
> 
> Also, you can plan to just do 10 or 15 minutes for tomorrow and then increase it in the following days.

> Habit is to read first aid. 
> Couldnâ€™t do it yesterday 
> Anxiety procrastination YouTube and you were right I shouldnâ€™t keep it for after dinner
> One of my biggest obstacle is the uncertainty about when exactly will I have to take the test
> Thereâ€™s this tiny possibility that I might not get to take the exam in 2 months when I was initially planning to
> And itâ€™s nothing in my control 
> Iâ€™ll get to know in a week hopefully
> But this uncertainty is increasing my anxiety and I donâ€™t feel like studying
> I donâ€™t know if anything made sense
> But Iâ€™ll work on it today
> Thankyou zoozla

> My pleasure!

> It will be easier for you to do your studying as a habit without the deadline looming than in a rush when you do. So regardless of when the exam happens, let's get you in a habit of studying daily.
> 
> As for your anxiety, two things may help -
> 
> 1) Write out what you're worried about. What's the worst case scenario? Is there anything you can do to improve your chances?

> 2) Use this app I built for stress relief, it should help clear your head: https://stress.wuju.app.

> No Iâ€™m not doing anything Iâ€™m just way too exhausted with everything going on and for now I just want a peaceful nice day and rn I donâ€™t even care about studying habits and anything. I just want to sleep or cry my heart out. Zoozla all this what youâ€™re doing is amazing but Iâ€™m so sorry I canâ€™t do this anymore. I genuinely appreciate your efforts.

> That's perfectly fine. If all this does is help you realize you need a break and a good cry, it's perfect. ðŸ’™
