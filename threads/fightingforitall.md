> Hey, Scott here. Improved a lot, great deal to go - right now, I'm struggling with keeping up habits which promote mental health. Spending a good block of time each day casually practicing music and exercising by walking does wonders for my mental health and ability to accomplish other things and support other people - but if I lose more than a day or two, I crash hard and often need a week+ to rebuild.

How do I continue to see something as essential after it has been working for a while?

> Sounds like what you're looking for is a quicker cycle to restart habits (because we all fall off the wagon once in a while). This program should definitely help you do that.

> We'll go through the steps of building up your music and exercise habits but pay special attention to the aspects of self compassion in this program which is the key to quickly restart habits.

> 1. The habit-set I would like to secure this week is the simple routine of walking and practicing music, each day. I seem to work best(?) when I A) accomplish tasks, B) exercise/explore, and C) progress creatively. Accomplishing tasks can be done on all but the worst days, but the inclusion of exercise and creativity strengthens/lengthens my productivity - in part by improving outlook/attitude and sleep.
> 2. Today, I plan to check-off mandatory regular To-Do List items, make progress on a sufficient number of current unique tasks (attempt to include one that is emotionally difficult if possible), and leave enough time/energy to walk and play music. Important to stop working in time to do these things, even if I don't feel I've 'earned it' yet.
> 3. I would like to be done with my tasks and ready to walk by 7pm today, if possible (further refinement to come later) - then walk for at least 30min before preparing dinner. 1hr+ walks are more enjoyable and net better results, but I suppose starting small and sticking with are the names of this game. If all goes well, I'll have time for \~45min music after dinner - during which I will be relaxed/accomplished enough not to beat myself up/shame my performance, while also not being so exhausted/late that I am unable to do more than noodle. Coming out of a slump, here, so I will stick practice to 10pm and sleep to 2am (in bed by 1am latest) for now and adjust as we go.
> 4. Remembering this will not be hard. I use a To-Do List for regular tasks, keep a written checklist of open responsibilities, and tend to set alarms for myself.
> 5. Things standing in my way include: A) carefully-made plans falling through (everyone I know is unreliable in this respect, and it seems to enrage/depress me to an overwhelming extreme) B) social interaction can be very difficult, before I get into a healthy rhythm C) there are several ongoing negative events in my life, and how much they hold me back is very dependent on my current perspective/confidence D) as is (I think) common, beginning something new can be very motivational/fulfilling, but when the immediate gratification wears off and you stop plowing through the beginning stages, risk and self-doubt emerge to sabotage progress.
> 6. Outset workarounds: A) plan things for myself, and invite people along for adherence to my plan, lead by me - I always set out hoping to do things together, but ultimately I like solo travel and meeting new people! Doing things my way while welcoming others along is the goal, here B) be polite, don't wear off-putting clothing, smile - it'll take off as I gain self-respect C) when I feel encumbered or defeated, I will do mindless tasks while listening to a helpful album, instead of giving up and laying down D) realistic timing/goals - if this week goes well, I would like to move forward gradually by learning a simple song (music) and sleeping out one night (exercise) - not putting these on the table until I have a stable streak going, though!

> Your plan sounds pretty ambitious. I think you should be able to pull it off, but notice any friction you feel doing it. We want to start building something you can do daily without friction or resistance and you might need to trim down you plan further to get there.

> 1. The habit I want to build is walking and practicing music, each day. I need to accept failure w/o creating additional setbacks, and stick with progress in all areas - instead of becoming intimidated by it.
> 2. I attempted to balance daily responsibilities with exercise/exploration, and was partially successful. On Monday I had a lot of upkeep tasks, no energy/desire to walk, and had not put in meaningful practice-work for a long time. On Tuesday I had a large errand to run, and the whole day was scheduled around that.
> 3. I wanted to be done with tasks and ready to walk by \~7pm on Monday - I was an hour late and did not have any desire to go, but did. Felt somewhat better after, slept alright. Got in some good practice for the first time in a long while (aiming for 10pm, over an hour late to start) but I became so excited and wanted to do so much that I blew my bedtime out of the water - just kept at that opportunity right through when I was supposed to put screens out, and missed being asleep by 2am by HOURS (not playing whole time, just LATE so screens ran until \~3am, etc.). Tuesday involved a long errand, during which I did plenty of walking. I was again frustrated by how long things take with other people, but there were no overt problems. By the time I got home, made and ate dinner / watched a short movie I felt too exhausted to practice - but then stayed up late (in bed) watching and doing other things. Where is the line between 'It's okay to skip a day if you're just not up to it' and 'putting in small amounts of regular effort makes everything easier'?
> 4. It seems that Monday had just enough fresh success to make me hunt for it - most of my idle thoughts since then have been about picking a song to learn, picking a teacher, figuring out which instrument/tuning etc. - and while that is exciting, it's not new and it won't bring success until I fix my approach to it. Tuesday, in part attempting to correct my mistake, I took it easy, Re: practice - and ended up similarly engaged, this time in unimportant things, and later even into the night. It was less productive and less fun, but similarly schedule-breaking. Sleep-patterns are part of this (as I am adjusting to earlier wake/sleep right now), but not the whole thing.
> 5. To improve my approach, I think I need to be less ridged with scheduling \[work/exercise/practice, separated each day in that order\] and how others compromise my efficiency. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to do this - I like the idea of doing my things my way, then being open to the whatever the world brings... but currently I feel like I may only choose one. If I do things my way, I'm so efficient I am briefly proud but I loose all connection to others - when I work around the plans/needs of others, I resent/dislike them quickly, lose my goals, and question my priorities. How on earth do I balance these things?
> 6. On Wednesday, we will see. I have a few important tasks, a favor to settle, big stuff waiting in the wings, and little confidence in my musical abilities. I would like to walk to a new place and learn a small new thing, musically, but we will see.

> 1. Today I again need to balance regular-task progress (both so I make a sufficient amount of it AND it does not eat into other things) with a good walk and some music practice.
> 2. Today, I will accomplish hygiene, meal-prep, and resource/finance tasks for the next week, as well as doing yesterday's and today's Soft Discipline check-ins. I will be ready to walk and leave BEFORE 8pm, and I will spend 15min of my music lesson choosing WHAT/WITH WHOM/HOW, for the immediate future. I will apply and enforce a screens-off hour before bed, but will not assign a time for this yet (no reason to guess>fail, here).
> 3. Being part-way through today, results are mixed, so far - objectively, progress has been sizable and successful so far, subjectively I am ashamed of my performance in at least one area. May have messed-up repaying favor, we will see. We'll see about music; a walk sounds nice. I have been short-tempered to others and unforgiving w/ myself, but not (unfortunately) more than has been average for the last month. I get the feeling tomorrow will tell.
> 4. Right now, I am tied up in processing ongoing tasks. Nothing is holding me back but nothing is inspiring me, either. I spent so much of my life with a best-friend or a partner that I have little experience working solo, long-term - ultimately, though, while working with SPECIALISTS \*is\* rewarding, I need learn basic training for my own life!
> 5. Standing still gets a body farther behind and (in my case, at least) creates shame (which impedes restarting!). Try moving slowly through the productive hours, no matter what - ANYTHING WORTH DOING IS WORTH DOING POORLY.
> 6. If today goes well, I will try to fold a difficult emotional confrontation w/ a friend and/or time to enjoy w/ my mother into tomorrow - more likely, though, today's results will be mixed and I will attempt the same goals tomorrow.
