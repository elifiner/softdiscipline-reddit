I then felt drained after 2 hours, but still went to the gym and did a full â€˜pushâ€™ routine successfully. After returning to the library, I felt tired and anxious, likely worsened by the coffee wearing off, but I continued to study and pushed through it. Thankfully, I got in a rhythm and it became easier to study as the day progressed.

> 1. Logging 5 hours of studying a day, not including breaks
> 2. My plan for yesterday was to wake up early, head to campus, eat breakfast, then to the library and study for the rest of the day.
> 3. I woke up around when I wanted to, but once I headed to campus, I realized/remembered that the campus cafeteria was closed on the weekend. As a result, I ended up having to use a good bit of time to sort myself a breakfast outside of campus. I also completely forgot that I had a dentist appointment that day, which took up 3 hours of my time including transportation, and was a bit stressful as I experienced some physical pain during the appointment. Nonetheless, I did some studying in the library before the dentist appointment and after the dentist appointment. I logged only 2.9 hours of studying by the time it reached 8 PM, and by the end of the day felt I couldn't fit any more information in.
> 4. Yes, I felt a lot of resistance after the dentist appointment. After it reached 8 PM, I decided to call it quits and head back home, as it wasn't getting any easier to concentrate.
> 5. Today, I sorted my own breakfast at home first (cheaper that way + healthier), and for the future, I'll try and remember all of my commitments before making my plan.
> 6. Today I'm currently at the library - just completed 1.7 hours of studying. I don't feel much resistance yet, so I'm going to continue until I reach 5 hours of studying then hopefully have enough time to attend a halloween party

> 
> 1. Studying 3 hours a day (was 5 hours)
> 2. Make food at home, then head to campus, then study at the library until my classes begin
> 3. Went great - I woke up very tired, so I decided to skip making food at home and head to campus and eat breakfast. After breakfast, I went ahead and did 1.7 hours of non-stop studying and felt absolutely no resistance. I then went to the gym with my friend and headed off to the library. Unfortunately, I had tech difficulties at the library (earbuds stopped working) so I headed home to continue studying. Once I headed home, I felt significant resistance and was only able to fit another hour of studying in, bringing my total for today to 2.7 hours. I then headed to class, and I have just returned from class. I am currently about to go get some food and head back and hopefully bring my study count up to 3 and hopefully beyond!
> 4. No resistance for the first 1.7! For the 1 hour I studied after returning from the library due to tech difficulties, I felt great resistance and just wanted to sit down and watch TV. I was thinking to myself "I deserve this break, I have been working so hard." I think this is because I feel more distracted at home, as I was gliding smoothly through the first 1.7 hours in the library.  So to fix this, I will definitely be doing as much studying as possible in the library, and not at home.
> 5. I feel like I did as best a job as I could given my circumstances, and I'm very happy with how things are going. A possible improvement would be to try and sort my issue with my earbuds so I can keep studying at the library, where I feel much more focused than at home
> 6. Wake up early - I woke up at 8:15 today, hopefully I can try and make it to 7:45 tomorrow morning, then head to campus, eat breakfast, study for 2 hours, head to the gym, study before my one lecture for the day, then continue studying after that lecture to try and hit 5 hours.

> Thank you!! I did!

> That's a good idea. I'll try and shift it to 3 hours a day, but still do my best every single day. The momentum idea is a very good point - for example, today, I couldn't hit more than 2.7 before it's now night - putting it at 3 will make the day still feel like a success, giving me momentum for tomorrow, so I completely agree! I'll shift my goal to 3 hours now.

> 
> 3) I am currently almost done with the day and it's a massive success! The only resistance I'm really feeling consistently is waking up - whenever I try and wake up early, I feel an extremely strong urge to get back to bed. But, once I wake up and get started with my day, I feel energized and that urge goes away. My first 1.7 hours studying had no resistance - I then went to my lecture, focused all the way through with no resistance at all (about 45 minutes of focus), and immediately headed to get lunch at campus and continue studying (no resistance). I felt a little bit of resistance after returning to the library, but not much at all and it went away fast. I currently am still at the library and have logged 3.6 hours with little resistance preventing me from continuing forward! My plan is to reach 4 hours and probably call it a day there. 
> 
> 4) Mainly waking up - I feel extreme resistance from getting up early, which I really want to do. 
> 
> 5) My one habit improvement that would make my life a lot better is getting up early. I'm not sure how to do this, but one idea I have is the 5 minute technique - I get up for only 5 minutes, and see how I feel. If I feel tired, I head back to bed, and if I feel energized, I continue with my day. I'll try waking up extra early tomorrow and using this technique.
> 
> 6) Wake up very early tomorrow - 7 am hopefully? Been averaging around 8:10 AM the past 2-3 days. Then continue my same plan - head to campus, eat breakfast, go to the library, study, head to classes, then back to the library to hopefully log 3 hours of studying and beyond.

> Got it - good tip to keep momentum, Iâ€™ll make sure to not push myself so hard to exceed my goal and leave plenty of rest time to recharge. I noticed that all my previous failed attempts to enact discipline were me pushing myself extremely hard - such as studying 10 hours a day - which only worked for a few days at most

This morning I did my first workout in a while and I had to fight a very strong urge to "pay back* for all the lost time with an extra strong workout. Instead I did a super short one, really just to bootstrap my habit again. The real benefits come from consistency, not from intensity.
