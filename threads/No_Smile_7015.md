> I think this is your first update for this cohort. Unfortunately this doesn't really work if you don't do the whole program.

> Maybe it makes more sense for you to join the next cohort and do it properly from start? You can join at https://softdiscipline.com/cohort.
> 
> As a quick trip, try to break out the first step of both of these tasks, something that will take 5 minutes or less.
> 
> Instead of studying, plan to just review the kind of studying you need to do for 5 minutes. Allow yourself to either drop it afterwards or continue studying if you have the energy.

> 1, Hey I'm sorry that I haven't been able to follow up on my habit. It's quite hard to start it. I know :(  
> 2. It's the last day and I did 1 Pomodoro session today! I only did 1/7 days.  
> 3. I think I can continue this habit tomorrow so yeah  
> 4. Would love to join the next cohort challenge. Thank you!

> And to be honest, I saw your messages but didn't reply on other days because I felt quite ashamed that I didn't finish the Pomodoro. Sorry, hope you understand :)

> I do. That shame you felt is very common and is the biggest hurdle to building sustainable habits. Part of my goal with this program was to relieve some of it, but it can run pretty deep.

> 1) Doing at least 25 minutes of add maths
> 2) Doing it when normally feel bored
> 3) 3-4:30 p.m in the afternoon
> 4) I use an app called timecap to remind 
> 5) The motivation/discipline to get it started and normally during this time period I usually play video games.
> 6) I plan to do 25 minutes of additional mathematics , and rewarding myself to play 5-10 mins of video game. I'm not sure if the video game part is okay or should I replace it with other thing?

> The reward sound good but choosing to do a hard thing at a time you feel least energetic might not be ideal.

> 1. Additional mathematics 25 min
> 2. Wanted to do it at around 3:30-5
> 3. did not manage to do it
> 4. 1. I get tired from sitting in front of the laptop seeing the screen cause I'm still studying online
> 5. It's still afternoon, ill try doing it earlier today.
> 6. I think it's better to do it during school time. Some classes will be canceled, So I'll have 1 hour of free time during that time.

> Ok, let's try during school time.
> 
> You can also plan to take a break and maybe go for a walk outside before your mathematics session.
