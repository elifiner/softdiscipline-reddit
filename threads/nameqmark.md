> I am planning to create better study habits. Tomorrow I will complete at least 2 Pomodoro's at 7pm. I'll naturally remember to do it. What can prevent me from doing it is feeling burned out after work, distractions. Someone reminding me could keep me accountable. u/zoozla

> Finally you can do two extra short pomodoros - 15  minutes of work, 5 minute break each.
