> Hey, I fell asleep just before you sent the first message. I managed to work for my math class, and also read. When I arrived home I tired and it was also quite late so I didn't complete the last 2 points. Also I didn't manage to wake up on time. Today I don't have time to follow yesterday's schedule, but for today I want to work again for my math class and do some lite exercise.

> Alright. It does help to have a more specific plan + what you're planning to do and when you're planning to do it. That way if it doesn't work you can take specific steps to adjust your plan for the next day.

> Is there something you need to do about your sleep schedule? There's an article I linked to in the first post of the cohort about adjusting sleep schedules. Might be useful.

> I still didn't manage to do some exercise. Whenever I say to myself let's do some exercise I start to feel tired or I start to procrastinate. At least working for my math classes went well. For today I am planning to continue working for my math classes either at a friends house after classes or at my house after I arrive home. I think that my current strategy for exercising where I do a workout at my home is not working. Do you have any tips about that?

> It sounds like you're trying to build multiple habits at the same time and you're not happy that you can't just become the persoy you want to be all at once. Your having some success with building a study habit and I'd focus on that first and leave the exercise for later.

> Also sounds like you have some judgement about yourself for not studying on Monday. If you take a break, take a break, let go of your judgements and enjoy yourself fully. If you don't allow yourself to rest, you won't be able to work.

> Having said that, I found it useful to keep habits alive by doing a tiny bit each day even on rest days.
