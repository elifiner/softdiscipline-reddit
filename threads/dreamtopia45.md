> I sat and worked for almost 2 hours, however I did face resistance before starting. Was annoyed and tired. Facing resistance today as well. Using the excuse that it is a Friday evening even though I have nothing planned. I will try and sit with it for atleast 30 mins. Will keep you posted. I missed the link to enroll in your soft discipline thread sorry!

**zoozla**
> Let's dig a little deeper into that resistance. How come you were annoyed? Why were you tired? Is there any way to work around these feelings or reduce them?

> I'm sorry my response took.such a long time, I was travelling for the last 24h.

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:42*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Oh please don't apologize! You are providing information and help for free. The annoyance was because I got into an argument with a family member. Managed to push it out and study though. I didn't study yesterday. Used Friday and tiredness as an excuse. I am on medication that causes fatigue so that could be one of the reasons. However I did study today afternoon and plan to study more later in the night.

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:44*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Yeah, meds can wreak havoc. Is there a different time you can study when the neds aren't affecting you? Or maybe shift the med schedule a bit?

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:46*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Unfortunately timing change won't help because it is a cumulative side effect. The good thing is I will be off it in another 6 months. My reasoning is if I can focus and set some discipline while on medication, it will be even better when I am off the medication. Thank you so much for what you do.

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:48*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Alright. So given that you'll just need to make sure you set achievable goals for yourself and don't push yourself too much. Aim for consistency, not intensity :)

> Is that argument thing ymwoth your family a common thing?

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:48*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Also I can't shift my study time slots way too much because I have a stressful full time job and need to get done with house chores. I could try waking up earlier to fit an hour in the morning but that would need two changes. Waking up early and then studying.

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:49*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Thag could be worth a shot, combined with an earlier sleep time.

<sub>*2021-10-31 02:50*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Not really. It was caused by us being hungry. Got resolved once we got some food into our belly. And true. Even 45 mins of studying everyday will eventually add up to something bigger.

**zoozla**

**dreamtopia45**
> So I didn't study yesterday. There were way two many tasks to complete and I ended up postponing studying. Woke up late today but I have scheduled an hour on my calendar post work to study so that I don't come up with excuses again. Will keep you posted.

<sub>*2021-11-02 20:23*</sub>
**zoozla**
> That doesn't sound like excuses, just prioritization. I'd recommend studying for at least 10 or 15 minutes just to build momentum and avoid self defeating thoughts. But considering studying and then decidong not to is still working with the habit, so I'd put a nice fat checkmark next to yesterday.

<sub>*2021-11-09 18:55*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**

**zoozla**
> Planning to schedule some time sounds like a meta plan :)
> 
> Why don't you actually schedule some time right now? Take a look at tomorrow and try to figure out when you can fit it in. If you want to start early in the morning, you'll need to go to bed early too, and plan for that as well.

> It's much better to have a concrete plan and fail to stick to it than to not have a plan at all. At least when you have a plan and fail you can learn and adjust.

<sub>*2021-11-10 04:12*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Fair point. I scheduled 30 mins for the end of today. My resistance is having a really long work day but I need to do this for myself. Will go at it 5 mins at a time.

<sub>*2021-11-10 04:58*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Sounds good. Maybe try to take a shower or do a light workout or both to freshen up before you tackle your studies tonight. Let me know how it goes.

<sub>*2021-11-10 15:59*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> 1) working on building a daily study habit. Even 15 mins are okay in general life but I am in interview time now so it has to be for 1 hour minimum
> 2) plan was to study towards the end of the day
> 3) even though I had scheduled time I did not end up studying yesterday as a major project started at work and I worked through my scheduled study time on it. 
> 4) not really because I was still being highly productive in my field
> 5) I need to prioritize studying over other tasks. 
> 6) not sure how to keep work only during work hours but that is what needs to be done

<sub>*2021-11-11 01:23*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Sounds like you have two conflicting priorities and you aren't really sure which one is more important - current work and studying for interviews. It also sounds that since the need to study is internal and need to work is external, you always prioritize work over studies.
> 
> The fact that you "need" to study for an hour every day is meaningless if you can't even do 15 minutes. I suggest you do start with 15 minutes tomorrow and try to schedule it at the beginning of the day - before work. See if this helps. Once you are able to allocate 15 minutes for a few days you can try to extend it to an hour.

<sub>*2021-11-11 01:39*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> I can try to do before work but work starts pretty early and I have to walk my pup prior to that which can't be neglected. Which means I'll have to develop a habit of waking up at 6:00 if I want to get 30 mins or so. However I can definitely start with 15 mins scheduled at 7:00 pm in the evening and slowly start working on my sleep so I can wake up early.

<sub>*2021-11-11 01:53*</sub>
**zoozla**
> That sounds good. Also, if you need to walk your pup in the evening it might make sense to do that and clear your head before you sit down to study for a bit.

<sub>*2021-11-11 15:57*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> I studied for an hour yesterday! So yay. However I was constantly distracted by my phone which is something I should look into as well. Why do I use my phone as a crutch?

<sub>*2021-11-12 00:02*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Congrats that's awesome!
> 
> Part of what draws you to your phone might be inertia, part might be FOMO, and part some resistance towards what you're studying.
> 
> Try to set it on airplane mode while you study and every time you feel the urge to look at your phone write down what the urge is for / about. The more you know about what's driving this behavior z the easier it will be to counter it.

> Hey! So I managed to study for 30 mins today since work took a lot out of me. However I noticed in general I spend a lot of time on my phone. Am I addicted to my phone? I definitely don't want to be... I will try using forest so I don't touch my phone for longer durations. I think I might have to build it up. Start with 10 mins of forest for every 30 mins and build it from there.

<sub>*2021-11-13 06:43*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Hey. So continuing yesterday's conversation, I use my phone to do almost everything I guess. Read books, videos (both productive and unproductive), emails, reddit, telegram. 
> I didn't study today because I decided to take today off. It is a Friday evening. Will definitely work on it tomorrow.

<sub>*2021-11-13 16:44*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Exactly. So being addicted to your phone is probably not the issue, but maybe to certain things you do on your phone.
> 
> Taking a break is really important. Although for the purpose of establishing a habit I found that it's better to do just a tiny tiny bit even on "off" days just to keep the mental model of "I'm doing this every day" going.

<sub>*2021-11-15 00:17*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Studied for three hours! Which is great however the lack of focus is still an issue. I guess I get bored very easily even though the subject matter is hard. Keep getting distracted. I will try to keep my phone in another room and work.

> Keeping focus is a different matter from building up volume. It's possible that it being hard is the reason you get distracted and you might need to plan more breaks. Do you know what the Pomodoro technique is? It's usually 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of rest, but you can go for 15/5 or even 10/5. Most apps should allow you to tweak the intervals.

<sub>*2021-11-15 01:23*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**

**dreamtopia45**
> I have been working on making time to study for the past two weeks but I would like to start a new habit this time around. I used to exercise semi regularly but then completely stopped 6 months ago. Haven't been able to bring myself to exercise. So I will pick out a 15 min video to start with the night before. Make some time after my evening walk to exercise or atleast sit with it for 5 mins.

<sub>*2021-11-16 01:20*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Sounds good. You might need to play at ound with the time of day and the length. Evening might be a low energy time for you and 15 minutes could be a lot to start with if you haven't worked out at all in a while. No such thing as starting too small, right?

<sub>*2021-11-17 07:23*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> I worked out for 15 mins! Won't lie, I was slightly annoyed so I decided to pick a dance based workout and did that. Glad I did. It made me feel better once I was done. Thank you!

<sub>*2021-11-17 07:24*</sub>
**zoozla**
> That's awesome! Where did the annoyance come from? Was that habit related?

<sub>*2021-11-17 07:30*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> Yes. My thought process was great, one more thing on my list. Had to reframe that thought into I want to do this. I also liked it because you can't not focus while exercising which is something I struggle with in daily life and while studying.

<sub>*2021-11-17 19:21*</sub>
**dreamtopia45**
> 1/start - struggled with studying. Couldn't focus and constantly had excuses. 
> 2/now - I still struggle but I maintained a streak of 5 days which is big for me. 
> 3/insights - even 15 mins of studying is better than none. I need to use the 15 on 5 off method to develop focus. Keep my phone away for a bit while studying. I also need to get to the mindset that I am doing this for myself. I could not study and just float but is that where I want to be 5 years from now?

<sub>*2021-11-17 20:25*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Absolutely! It's not just a streak, it's a whole new approach. Every time your habit fails instead of being hard on your self you can just do a bit of reflection, see what didn't work out and adjust.

> Beautiful progress!
