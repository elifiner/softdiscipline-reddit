> Hi I’m Rini! I am studying for my exams in 60 days. I need to be studying for 12-14 hours, but my schedule is all over the place. I don’t sleep on time, which makes me lazy throughout the day. I also need to inculcate some form of exercise to wake my brain and body up.
> At this point, I’m just procrastinating everything, and then I panic at the very last minute.
> I’ve been trying to build a proper schedule for more than a year now, but not able to, which has resulted in me failing my exams.
> I have tried the pomodoro technique, studying on discord study servers with my camera on for accountability. But somehow I get distracted, either by my phone, or laptop, or I end up daydreaming.

> Edit: I hope the registrations aren’t closed. I saw this too late

> Well first thing's first. You're not going to study 12-14 hours a day by the end of this week, and it's probably an unreasonable goal anyway. I doubt anyone can do more than 4-6 hours sustainably and you'll need to do this for two whole months of without burning out.

> 1. Habit - sleeping at a fixed time, drinking more water, studying for 6 hours
> 2. Plan - I plan to make a schedule fixing my sleep timings, putting reminders to drink water and writing down my study targets on a board
> 3. Time - I plan to shut off my devices by 2.30 and sleep by 3 to wake up at 9. Put water reminders for as soon as I wake up, before and after every meal and once before I sleep. For my studies, I’ve tried to not make a rigid schedule as it only ends up overwhelming me and I get nothing done by the end of the day. Instead I have my targets written and I a rough estimate of when I’ll sit to study
> 3. Reminder - i have a rough schedule written on a huge whiteboard beside me. It’ll be a constant reminder
> 4. Obstacles - my late night coffee keeps me up at night, I’m too lazy to fetch water, and my mind wanders to different apps while studying
> 5. Workaround - drinking chamomile tea, instead of coffee at night, keeping 3 bottles of water on my desk, for easy access, it’ll also be a reminder to drink water. Putting my phone on focus mode and keeping it away from me, using the forest app on my laptop which’ll block all websites I don’t require while studying.

> I hope this works for me

> Only comment is that you're planning 6 hours of sleep and unless you're a very unique person that will not be sustainable over a long period of time.

> Other than let's do this and see how it goes.
