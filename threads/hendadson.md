> Unfortunately that's not enough of a plan to know if you succeeded or failed and why. You don't seem to be applying yourself to this. Is this because you have little hope of it working or because it's not actually that important for you?

> hi iâ€™ve been consistent from the start of this month. Studying at least 2 hours a day. Yesterday i did 4 hours. I have an important maths and english exam coming up so expect these hours to increase. Um, i feel like the amount of time spent is not as important as what i do. So i need to cram in some past papers . thanks for checking in :)
