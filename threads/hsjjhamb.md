> Plan for tomorrow:

> My friend, you're blaming yourself instead of adjusting your plan to make it easier and increasing your chances of success.

> Your schedule doesn't make sense to me. Do you work night shifts until 12am and then study? And then you go to sleep at 3am? When do you wake up? When does your job start? When do you plan to study? I'm obviously missing something here.

> Sounds like the best time to exercise and study would be right after you wake up, which is your start of day and the time your body should the most energy. In particular studying after work doesn't sound optimal.

> I admit I have little experience with a schedule like this and my advice may be meaningless. Regardless, it's not about discipline, it's about working with your schedule and energy levels to find the optimal time for you to work out and study and to start slowly and then build up.
