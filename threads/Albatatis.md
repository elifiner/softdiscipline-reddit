> That is absolutely true and that's what those foborts are all about. I can help you stick to it for 7 days and there's a good chance you'll be able to carry on on your own after that.

> Let's aim a little lower and start you off with 30 minutes a day of studying. What's the best time for you to do it? Can you do it first thing in the morning?
