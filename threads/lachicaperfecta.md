> I am planning to do 120 SAT prep questions - 60 math, and 60 English, and study Spanish more. I am planning to study for the SAT early in the morning, and my Spanish later in the day. I will set a reminder on my laptop and work on not writing my book until I'm finished studying. I may not be motivated, or I may fall into a depressive spiral. I will practice self-care and remind myself about my goal of straight A's and an SAT score of 1400 or above.

> Depending on what you're currently able to do every day, 60 math and 60 English might be way too high a goal. I'd go for 1/4th of that for the first day (15 math + 15 English) and slowly increase over the next few days.

> Also, you're writing a book?! How awesome! What's it about? How far along are you?

> Good to know, haha! I'm not the best at setting goals - either I go too high or too low. Thanks so much for the advice!
> 
> And my book!!! Yes!!! I'm writing a novelization of a musical I *love* (We Are The Tigers!!) so it's a murder mystery!!! I'm about 3/4 of the way through the first draft, and after which, I will send to some friends to give advice so I can save some money from an editor, before I go to get it published!

> That is awesome! You know, I noticed that there's a new trend of writing books in public and publishing chapter drafts as they are written. It helps create an early audience, reduces some of the need for editing and seems fun too.

His book isn't fiction, but the same things might apply. He's a super nice guy and if you DM him on Twitter he'll write back ( and if he doesn't, let me know and I'll smack him upside the head :)

> Hi, Zoozla! My first habit was to study more for the SAT and classwork. I figured out I learn my classwork better in the morning, so I flipped my og plan. However, I got an A on a spanish test!!! I'm struggling with math SAT. I barely wanted to get up today. Tomorrow, I will aim for a spoken Spanish exam minus the stuttering, while allowing for hesitance.

> There's a bunch of things going here, let's unpack them in order.
> 
> First of all congrats on the Spanish test!
> 
> Now, your plan was to study for 15 minutes of Math and 15 minutes of English and it sounds like you're hitting some resistance.
> 
> It also sounds like you might not be getting enough sleep which combined with your math anxiety is causing some problems. Is that the case? We may need to focus some attention on that.
> 
> Tomorrow you're focusing on Spanish and that's cool. I'd like to add one more thing to it - spend 5-10 minutes tomorrow writing out your feelings about math - whatever anxiety, insecurity, past failures and inadequacy you feel - write it down and post it here. Let's see if we can glimpse the root of your issues here.
