> 2. I plan to eat less and workout on 10:30am before I eat my first meal

> 4. I downloaded schedule apps that can remind me when I need to workout and log in.

**zoozla**
> I don't have enough here to offer any thoughts or advice, but I'm curious about losing motivation mid workout. Lowering intensity may help, butndo you also have some thoughts about it not helping anyway? What's you goal for the workouts?

<sub>*2021-09-30 14:09*</sub>
**gwen-gwen**
> To atleast complete the whole 30 minutes HIIT. I always increase my level to 2 cause its harder but now I decreased it to 1. And yeah sometimes it doesnt, like I get distracted anyways and use my phone.

**zoozla**
> If you're going for a sustainable habit rather than a few high intensity days and then a long break, doing eaiser workouts is generally better, decreasing intensity sounds like a good idea.

<sub>*2021-09-30 14:19*</sub>
**gwen-gwen**
> So I will do high intensity for 3 days then break for 3 days? Or ill just do everyday but lower intensity like I always do?

**zoozla**
> It's easier to establish a daily habit you sometimes skip than an intermittent habit you never skip.
> 
> So for the purpose of habit building I'd go shorter and easier and daily. After that's firmly established and part of your identity, you can play around with high intensity days and breaks of course.
> 
> As a case in point, I have a daily workout habit. That doesn't necessarily mean I work out every day, but I check with my body and energy levels every day to see if I need to do a high intensity workout, a low intensity one, or just take a break.
> 
> I never forget about it, because it's part of my identity by this point, but I don't hold myself to strict streaks either.
> 
> It also means it's very easy for me to get back to regular exercise even if I need to take a break for a week due to sickness or injury.

**gwen-gwen**
> So I need to keep working out in small intensity and be consistent. And once it feels like its a part of my day rather than im forcing myself to do it THEN i can increase my workout?

> Ps: It was really different experience with you and telling things on what I did today and what happened is Im working out to get better but to tell you that I did it is the other reason why I did. I know it might not be a good thing that I depend too much on you but im working on it with a new thing, a diary. But thank you once again with the reflection and plans we did.

**gwen-gwen**
> So about my habit was working out in the same time and completing it all together.

> Since I done my first completed workout, all the days after that was also completed. Except 2 breaks either I was too busy helping my mom and my body was sore. I also try to find a accountability buddy and work things out but we have timezone difference so it was a struggle. But thankfully my weight is slowly getting down and never forget my weight loss diary. And yeah, its going well.

**zoozla**
> That sounds really good. So what do you want to do this time around? It sounds line your workout habit is under control. Do you want to work on something else?

**gwen-gwen**
> So I want to work on doing my school works. We are still online class and my school provided modules or 9 answer (7-12 pages) sheets that need to be passed every 2 weeks. Sometimes I have sudden burst of energy like 'YEAH LETS DO THIS' but most of the days are like 'i dont want to do it cause its hard' even tho its only 4 pages left.

> Its not like I dont complete them, I do. Its just so inconsistent, it will always be the last day I have to cramp everything in the last minute when I have like all the time before.

<sub>*2021-10-19 20:50*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Sounds like a basic daily studying habit, starting with maybe 20-30 minutes a day and building it up to a sustainable level. You won't need to rely on any massive energy burst, just a daily habit of doing some studying.

**zoozla**
> Yeah, I think I understand. The problem is that thinking "I have to do this" doesn't necessarily get you to do it.
