> Hi, I want to work on studying. I take a number of difficult courses and want to study more so I can pass. I usually get home and procrastinate for hours and then cram for exams. I want to study for an hour a day at least. I've tried in the past to make plans where I set aside specific hours of the day to work, but it's never worked and I always justify spending hours on social media instead. This time I'm gonna try to just get the energy to sit down once at any time for one hour and study.

> Sounds good. The best way to build up a studying habit is to start really small, maybe 30 minutes or even 15 minutes a day.
> 
> I'll post an invitation to do the first daily planning with some instructions in a bit and we'll get started.

> I ended up studying for 3 hours yesterday which is 3x my goal. I don't have much of a choice to study less because of my workload but I'll do my best to keep it up!

> Keep it up, but also be kind to yourself and take breaks and definitely get enough sleep. Nice job on yesterday!

> Honestly it's pretty hard today. I did 4+ hours of work yesterday but can't get up the courage to do what I have to for today. The work is mandatory but I'm just burnt out.
> 
> 1. Studying for an hour a day
> 2. Use a study video timer to complete my work
> 3. It went quite well. I didn't end up following the plan, I just went for it and studied.
> 4. Lots of resistance today. I feel like I'm working hard but not working hard enough. It's hard for my to work on more engaging problems that take a lot of brain power to figure out.
> 5. I think I need to have a more positive mindset because my mindset is getting me down. Everything just sucks right now. When I catch up on all my work, my habit will feel more manageable because I'll be able to do work as it comes in.
> 6. Taking a test then I have practice. I'll probably take a nap and then complete literature assignments around 7:00 pm. Early to bed I hope.
> 
> u/zoozla Thank you for all your help and dedication to replying! Talking about my plan is actually making me more excited to work on it. I know if I work hard now all my built up work will be finished by the end of tomorrow and I can chill and reset.
> 
> Edit: sorry if I don't respond some days. I am not on reddit every day but I think my habit formation is gonna be successful!

> 
> You're doing fine my friend. If anything you are pushing yourself too hard, rather not hard enough, which is why you're feeling burnt out.
> 
> Building a sustainable habit means going at 60-70% on normal days, so you have more to give at crunch time.
> 
> It also means gradually extending what your 100% is through improved effectiveness, better rest, and better prioritization.
> 
> Prioritization is in turn realizing what you're realistically capable of and dropping everything that doesn't fit. Failing to do so leads to burn out and just dropping the things you didn't get to which tend to be the scarier and more important things.

> Hope this makes sense.

> Makes a lot of sense! I wish I could lay back a bit but since my classes are so rigorous I have to be at 100% right now. Hopefully today is the last day though so I'll be able to work at a more healthy level. I just had to make up for the days when I didn't do much so I can now establish this habit. Thanks for all your help so far! Also I ended up studying for less than an hour yesterday because of scheduling problems.

> Hey! Sorry I finished most of my work and then shut down for a second lol! I got 3 hours of sleep on Friday but finished most of my assignments. I took a break from studying on Saturday but still had work. And today I chilled for most of the day but plan to do 2 assignments. I feel much more refreshed after finally getting some weekend sleep. Overall I'm almost all caught up and ready to start operating on a more healthy normal schedule. Thanks for you help so far! The cohort is ending in two days, right? I would like to also join the next one hopefully if there is one.
> 
> Tomorrow I will complete two assignments between the hours of 5-6 and 9-10.

> Yep, I don't have any plans of stopping this although I need a bit of a break. Next one is going to start Oct-16 and you can sign up at the same place: https://softdiscipline.com/cohort

> Nice work on your things, although it sounds more like a mad rush than a sustainable habit to me :)

> 4) I hope to be able to stay on top of my assignments and at the very least turn them all in.
