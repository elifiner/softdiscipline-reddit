> Hey, it's me Yigi.  I have a great urge to lose pounds. As soon as possible. And that's why I join the wagon.  30 minutes for lifting weight and 1 hour to exercise for a day is okay. I can do that, I should have done that before. Now it's time. Also, to improve my mind,  need to meditate for 20 minutes and 1 hour to reading. I used to read a lot, especially about Russian Literature. That bookworm kid should be back here. Right now. I started. By the way, the program you've created looks promising, thanks to you.

> You're eager, I'll give you that. But you need to take things a little slower. See if you can choose one habit to build for this week - either working out, meditating or reading. Probably exercising if you ask me. And I think you'll need to set your goals a lot lower at first, so low that you don't need any willpower to do them. Probably 30 minute workout total, maybe even less.

> Hi, Thank you man.
> 
> 1-my habit was exercising for 30 minutes. It was my second day at habit. It was okay for the first day but today I failed. I feel sad
> 
> 2 and 3- Plan and time were in the night. I love night walks.
> 
> 4- I failed today because I forgot that. When I remembered that I was busy ... :(
> 
> 5- I feel so tired and when I eat late I feel like I can't exercise so I should eat earlier.
> 
> 6- I will do that just after I arrive at home after work

> You didn't fail my friend, your plan did. And adjusting your plan is just the ticket. Aside from changing the time, try to reduce your workout time to minimum 10 or 15 minutes so you can do it when exhausted too.

> No I didn't give up, keeping up doing. Yesterday I exercised 40 minutes. Sorry for late response.
> 1- I'm working on exercising for at least 30 minutes every day 
> 2- my plan is in doing it just after waking up in weekend and in weekdays doing it while coming back to home from work
> 3- I did it for 3 days I'm getting tired. Because I am heavy and unconditional physically 
> 4- So far so good I am 106 kg right now and wanna be less than 100 till the end of the year
> 5- I may consider to hit up gym for doing more and losing weight quickly 
> 6- for today and tomorrow when my work ends, I will walk next to the shore towards home for 30 minutes and lift my dumbbells at home 
> Thank you for meticulous effort to keeping us in a way sir

> If you're getting tired you should be doing less, not more. The key to a consistent habit is to moderate yourself and do about 60-70% of your maximum ability.

> You'll be much closer to your ideal weight if you do light exercises for the entire duration than if you go hard, burn out and stop exercising altogether.

> Your last post is the most important one. You're going to skip days, that's a given. That's why I'm not a big fan of streaks and the guilt associated with breaking them. Sleep, recharge, restart. It's all part of the larger pattern. Have a nice rest :)
