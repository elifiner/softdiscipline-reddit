> I’ve tried and tried but fall victim to shortcomings and laziness after awhile. I exert my energy and do nothing on days on end. I feel like my mind and body is tired all the time and fogged. I’ve tried taking supplements and managing my time but the mind will always tire me out. On top of that, I have no real sleeping schedule.

> That's quite the list and we won't be able to tackle all of this in one go.
> 
> I'd like you trim down the list to find that one habit it makes sense to start with. You can do that by crossing out every habit on your list that you feel you can postpone, until you end up with the only one you can't push away and have to start working on right now.

> Let me know what you come up with and we'll get started.

> The reason being was to have an overview of what I’d like to work on for myself. But I agree, I should focus on one main goal at a time. With that being said, I’d like my main goal to work on with you to be:
> • go to the gym for weight training + cardio daily

> 1. My habit that Id like to work on and improve is going to the gym for weight training + cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis. 
> 
> 2. I plan to wake up at 3-4AM and be the first one at the gym to do a chest workout + cardio + a light swim + hot tub/steam room afterwards. Reason being for the early hours, is because I become self conscious around others when it comes to where I’m at physically or in my progress and in the morning upon opening is when there are the least amount of people where I can focus on my goal at hand and have the peace needed to clear my head.
> 
> 3. My plan is to do it tomorrow at 4-5AM. I plan on staying for two hours upon arrival.
> 
> 4. I have set an alarm with the title: GOAL - Go to the gym! 
> 
> 5. Waking up late, not sleeping at all, telling myself I’ll do it tomorrow, and/or letting my insecurities talk me out of it.
> 
> 6. Going to sleep at around 8-9PM tonight, telling myself that it starts today!, and going to the gym early enough where I can be the only person at the gym.
> 
> • 4-5 Exercises for Chest with reps of 10
> • 10-20m Cardio Walk or HIIT walk/run if possible
> • Light swim + hot tub/steam room to clear my mind
> • Do as much as possible, even a little is more than nothing and will set you on the right path
> 
> Thanks u/zoozla I’m ready for this! 💪🏽

> You're hyping yourself up to do this, which makes this inherently unsustainable. If you want to do this for a day or two, your way will work. If you want to change your habits for life you'll need to take a different approach.
> 
> If you can only work out of no one sees you, you can start with bodyweight training at home and slowly adjust your sleep schedule until you can go to the gym when it opens.
> 
> Please take a look at my sleep schedule plan. If it's a bad fit for you, tell me why and we'll find a better way, but don't try to fix the whole thing in one go.
