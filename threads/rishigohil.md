> Being sick is not a failure, it's just reality. And trying to catch up because you've been sick will either cause you to feel even worse about yourself (if you can't do it) or burn out (if you do).

> If you want to build a sustainable habit you'd be better served by doing just one problem tomorrow. Then 2 problems the day after. Then 3 problems on the third day.
> 
> On the other hand, if you have a hard deadline and you need to cram, just go for it, and leave the habit building for another time.
