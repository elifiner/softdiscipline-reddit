> 1. Writing consistently.
> 2. Balance my energy level and observe my content consumption throughout the day so I could still maintain the amount of time and energy I need to follow through building a writing habit.
> 3. There's little to no distraction at night so I plan to write during this time.
> 4. A reminder note that I could easily view would probably help me a lot in remembering.
> 5. Probably scrolling aimlessly through my phone.
> 6. I can try to keep my phone out of reach for a while and reward myself with leisure browsing after I finish my task.

> Sounds good. It will also help to set a reasonably low but specific goal for your writing - 500 words or 30 minutes or something like that. Something that feels low enough to keep resistance and anxiety to a minimum. Even 100 words would work.

> Thanks! I've managed to write 200 hours last night and I felt really good. I'm planning to write some more before I go to bed. I'll keep you updated!

> I hope it's 200 words, otherwise you may have broken space-time :)

> 1. i'm working on writing.
> 2. my plan was to spend at least an hour of concentrated work.
> 3. it went well and i'm really excited about the subject i came up with!
> 4. resistance was present though i've managed to pull myself up through, surprisingly, not forcing myself to overthink what i'd write.
> 5. i could probably be a lil kinder to myself, i guess. 
> 6. tomorrow i plan to sit in front of my computer at the same time of the night and follow through my writing.

> Hi. Sorry for the late reply and thanks for waiting.
> 
> 1. Daily writing.
> 2. Write for at least an hour.
> 3. I've sliced my writing practice into two: mornings are for journalling while nighttime are for more meticulous subjects.
> 4. The resistance I get is from the discomfort of pinning down the contents of my mind on a blank page--but it's steadily fading the more I confront it.
> 5. I noticed that if I sit with the intention of writing the minimum, I don't dwell too much on the outcome. My brain is more relaxed and therefore willing to form structure. I think I'm gradually getting the hang of it and I'm writing with more ease and enjoyment.
> 6. Tomorrow I plan on soft persistence even if it's the weekend!

> That is aweomse! I love that idea of "soft persistance" it's even more appealing than soft discipline :)

> 1. Writing.
> 2. Sit for an hour and make something out of my mind.
> 3. I've been consistently writing for five consecutive nights until last night when I didn't get to write because I felt like switching to some other activity--lest I feel restricted by what I'm trying to build. I'm aware that skipping a day could be a potential threat to forming a solid habit because it happened to me lots of times before. Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure that my willingness would not easily falter this time.
> 4. I thought a lot about other things I could be doing.
> 5. I think my habit could be improved by eliminating distractions an hour before writing so that I could dwell with the task with more focus and ease.
> 6. Tomorrow could be quite a challenging night to write but I will try. Tomorrow my only plan is to try.

> Skipping a day intentionally is not detrimental to habit building - it is essential for it, for the exact reason you mentioned. You need to make sure you still have freedom and the ability to choose what's best given current circumstances.
> 
> Be careful with planning to try. It's much better to plan a tiny little bit (e.g. 100 words) than to try. The problem with trying is that you can put a checkmark next to it whether you did it or not. And you won't be able to tell how to improve your plan or approach.
