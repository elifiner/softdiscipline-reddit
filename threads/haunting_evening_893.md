> Thanks for this. I'm trying this out for the first time and hopefully it will motivate me.

> I'm planning to have a week of healthy eating and studying for my exams. I'd also like to introduce some light stretching/exercise and do this every day. I know I'll be forgetting about trying to have a healthier diet if I don't put constant reminders somewhere. I expect to meet significant resistance, to name a few chronic pains in my feet, toxic family member and my smartphone. But if I come through it will be rewarding! What can help me do it? Mostly if I just start without thinking too much about it I finish my work or at least do the bare minimum. I'll just get up early and start studying without bemoaning about how difficult things are.

> I see, then I'll pick studying. If I did the rest it would be a bonus but the studying is the most important. Thank you for the advice and good luck to you too, if you're doing something.

> Hello. Thank you so much for all your help and support but I decided not to join after all. I am trying to instill more than one habit this week.
