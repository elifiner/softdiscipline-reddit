> Hey I’m sure excited about this! :)
> 
> The habits I’d like to work on are sleeping and exercising. I’d really like to be able to wake up earlier consistently. Sometimes I’m up at 5am and I feel great, I get a bunch of stuff done before my first class starts and I feel incredible. Other times I hit snooze and then I’m late and grumpy the whole day. I used to wake up at 6am everyday before the pandemic but now everything’s just really wacky. My first class is at 7:50am so it’d be awesome if I could wake up early enough to get some me-time in the morning. The most annoying thing is that I can’t figure out what it actually is? Sometimes 8 hours of sleep is perfect and I wake up feeling awesome while other days, 8 hours is just not enough and I wake up feeling like a mountain troll. 
> 
> And then exercise. I used to work out 7 days a week, mostly cardio and a bit of strength but then I skipped a day which lead to me skipping a month and it’s been a year since I’ve had an actual plan that I’ve followed through with. 
> 
> I know I need to start with 3-4 days a week before I get back to exercising the way I used to. But every time I skip a day, I give up on myself. Some weeks I’m working out twice a day and some weeks I’m just not working out at all. I’m really upset about it and every time I try to change, it doesn’t stick. It doesn’t work. And then I get mad at myself and I try again and it doesn’t stick and yeah, it’s not fun :(
> 
> I think one thing that’s not working is me holding myself to standards that I achieved in the past. I know I need to accept that I’m not that person anymore but I really want to be. If I could work out everyday then, I should be able to now. I don’t know why I can’t :(
> 
> I filled the form and I can’t wait for the rest of the week :D

> Welcome!
> 
> So a couple of notes here. I suspect your need for sleep depends on your emotional state, so it would be helpful to track that. The easiest way to do that is to notice the kinds of thoughts you have running through your head when you wake up but can't really get out of bed.
> 
> There's likely something about your day that you're resisting and once you figure that out you'll be able to work around that.
> 
> Your sleep schedule sounds fine otherwise.
> 
> As for exercise, I find that building a daily habit that you occasionally skip is much easier than building an intermittent habit that you need to stick to. It amounts to the same result but with a very different mindset.
> 
> So for this week lets focus on light exercise but done every day, so you get into the habit.
> 
> I'll post an invitation to do the first daily planning with some instructions in a bit and we'll get started.

> Hi Eli! Here’s my plan for today:
> 
> 1. What’s the habit?: Exercise and waking up early 
> 
> 2. What are you planning to do tomorrow? : Just 10 minutes of exercise, really simple cardio. Mostly low impact.
> 
> -Wake up at 5:30 using the sleep plan since I woke up at 6am for the past few days and I think I’m almost used to it.
> 
> 3. When?: I plan on exercising in the evening after my last class.
> 
> 4. How will you remember to do it? : Reminders on my phone and I left a post it note on my mirror to exercise :)
> 
> I have an alarm on my phone and another alarm on the table so I’ll have to get up to switch it off. 
> 
> 5. What can keep you from doing it?: My own reluctance and negative thoughts. I used to be able to work out for way longer and so 10 minutes sounds silly, like I haven’t really done anything. I’m worried that I’ll convince myself that it doesn’t actually make a difference and skip on it entirely.
> 
> The weird thing is, I’m not sure if I’m trying to build new habits here. I wake up early sometimes but I want to be up early, all the time. I really really want to be consistent with it. I feel lousy since I can’t commit to it. It’s either waking up at 5:00 am or sleeping in and missing my first few classes. I used to wake up late and hate myself for it. Sometimes I wake up early and I feel amazing. But it feels like I’m stuck between both of those right now. I’m stuck between the person I used to be and the person I want to become. I’m not sure what to do.
> 
> Should I start with trying to wake up at 9 and then work towards 5?
> 
> 6. How can you work around that?: I’m going to try to remind myself that 10 minutes is better than zero. If a negative thought pops up to bully me, I’ll try to just bully it back. 
> 
> If I don’t feel like getting out of bed, I’ll try to think of what task or set of thoughts are creating that friction like you mentioned before. Maybe if I could recognize what’s making me so anxious about actually waking up, I can find a way to wake up feeling less horrible.
> 
> 
> Summary:
> ◯ Exercise for 10 minutes 
> 
> ◯ Try to wake up early//identify what task makes me want to stay in bed

> Hey Eli! 
> 
> I exercised for 10 minutes so I can tick that off. I really really didn’t want to but since it was just low impact and for such a short period of time it went by really quickly. I’m pretty happy about that! :D
> 
> I didn’t wake up at 5:30, I woke up at 7 instead :((( My first class is at 8am so I had a pretty stressful morning. I was a bit late to class, not fun. I actually woke up at 5:30 but I went back to bed because I didn’t really know what to do. I’m going to try to make a plan for the day at night so I can wake up with more purpose. :D

**zoozla**
> Could it be that you actually a lot you need to do, but there's resistance or anxiety preventing you from getting into any of that?
> 
> Simplest way around that is in your planning, figure out the first step of any bigger project and write only that on your tasks list.
> 
> E.g. "Build a successful business" -> "Go online and find 5 courses under $1000 that teach business skills"

> Hey Eli! Time zones are really weird, today is the end of day 1 for me so I guess this would be my plan for tomorrow, day 2.
> 
> 1. Habit: Exercising and waking up early
> 
> 2. Plan: My plan was to wake up at 5:30 since I’ve been waking up at 5:30 for the past few days and I thought I could do it. And exercise for 10 minutes, low impact cardio.
> 
> 3. How did it go?: Well, not horrible but I do feel pretty bad. I’ve been waking up at 5:30 for the past three days because I had homework I needed to catch up on so I thought I could wake up early today as well. And yeah, that didn’t happen. I woke up at 5:30 and I went back to bed in a couple of minutes. :(((
> 
> As for exercise, I was pretty upset with a bad test score that I got today and the workout was pretty high impact cardio instead of low impact like planned.
> 
> 4. Resistance?: Well I felt a lot of resistance towards waking up but I felt almost none whatsoever for exercising. My thought process about the whole waking up thing was basically just - what’s the point. And now that I’m awake and actually thinking, I know what the point is- having more time to get things done, journaling in the morning which I absolutely love, having time to make breakfast instead of starving and being hangry till lunch, actually feeling good and showing up presentable to class instead of looking like a koala in hoodies who just woke up. 
> 
> 5. Improve approach: So I’m going to plan out my mornings the night before so I can actually see what the point is. I’ll put in time for journaling and making breakfast because those are actually enjoyable activities for me and I hope it’ll make me feel more happy about waking up. Instead of 5:30, I’m going to try to wake up at 6:30, which is only half an hour earlier than when I usually wake up anyway. As for exercise, I don’t really know. I think I’ll go ahead with 10 minutes of low impact cardio and maybe a couple of days later I can try to improve more.
> 
> 6. Plan for tomorrow:
> 
> Habit: Waking up and Exercising
> 
> ◎Wake up at 6:30 (Reminder: Alarm)(Obstacle: not having clear reasoning) (Workaround:
> Morning schedule: <shower-journal-homework-get to class> )
> 
> 
> ◎ Exercise for 10 minutes after classes, low impact cardio. (Reminder: Post it note and reminder on my phone) (Obstacle: I might have an extra class and I’d finish with classes around 1800, I’d feel wayyy too tired to do anything) (Workaround: If I cant get myself to actually do any low impact cardio, I’ll try to go for a walk or just do 5 minutes instead of 10)

> Hey Eli!

> 1. My habits are exercising and waking up earlier.

> 2. My plan was to create a schedule for the morning so I would wake up with more coherence about what I had to achieve for the day and exercise for 10 minutes in the evening after class.
> 
> 3. It went okayy. I woke up and that was awesome! I didn’t aim for 5:30 like yesterday and went with 6:30 instead which was more attainable and it made me feel super amazing. Exercising didn’t go as planned since I wasn’t home after class so I decided to go for a walk when I got home instead.
> 
> 4. Not much resistance towards waking up! I did snooze the alarm once but after those extra 10 minutes of sleep, I was ready to start the day. I did feel a lot of resistance to exercising. I was supposed to do it in the evening and since I did it at night instead, I felt pretty upset about it.
> 
> 5. I’m not too sure. I’d really love to hear your feedback! I think I can stick with 6:30 for another day and then push it to 6:00am. As for exercise, I really don’t know. Maybe I need to try planning differently?

<sub>*2021-10-01 08:32*</sub>
**nikiki_**
> Well when I was up and ready to face the day, I felt super excited. I was looking forward to cooking up a quick breakfast because I don't usually get to eat before class when I wake up late.   
> With exercise, I think it was that I thought I'd already messed it up. I planned to work out in the evening but I wasn't home, when I did get home I thought it was too late. In retrospect, it's pretty silly but in my head I thought that it was already ruined since I didn't stick to the plan :(

<sub>*2021-10-01 09:42*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Be careful with that "it's already ruined" thought. It is indeed silly, but it's also pervasive. A potential counter thought is "you only fail if you give up" and also the realization that the past doesn't matter, only your next decision does.

> 3. It went really well! I’m so happy, I woke up at 6 and I had the time to shower and make breakfast and journal a bit. Maybe if I wake up earlier or spend less time on breakfast I can do some homework too. As for exercising, not having a fixed time to do it at really helped. Also I absolutely loved the idea of converting negative thoughts like “it’s already ruined” to positive thoughts like “you only fail if you give up.” Thank you! I think that played a huge role in my outlook towards my day. 
> 
> 4. Not as much resistance towards exercising as yesterday :D. It was almost fun, I chose a pretty simple workout with no equipment so it went by fast and I felt great. A bit of resistance towards waking up today because the weather wasn’t that great and I wanted a sunny bright morning. I also took a really long time to get myself together in the morning, I had to get my journal from the other room, I spent a long time trying to find my plan that I wrote out at night and it was just really messy. So that made me want to go back to bed a lot. 
> 
> 5. I know I need to improve but I don’t know how. I have a long way to go until I can get to working out for half an hour a day and waking up at 5am but I’m not sure where to go from here. For exercising, I’m definitely going to continue with no equipment workouts until I’m comfortable enough. It’s much better this way because I feel like I just expected my body to somehow be at the same level of strength as it was before but now I can accept that it’s not. It’s weird how something as physical as exercising is impacted so much by the mental side of things.

> Hey Eli!   
> Today was a bit different.
> 
> 1. Habit: Waking up early and exercising 
> 2. Plan: Wake up at 6am <stretch-shower-journal-make breakfast before class> and exercise for 10 minutes 
> 3. Result: Well my classes for the day were cancelled and so I slept in till 8 am :( I went ahead with the morning routine that I've been going ahead with since the beginning of the week and I definitely felt much better after it even though I didn't wake up early. I exercised for 15 minutes today and I'm really happy about it, I moved up from low impact to high impact exercises :D
> 4. Resistance: I felt a lot of resistance towards doing anything at all today morning. Since I woke up late and it felt like I'd broke the streak that I've been building slowly. But reminding myself that it's only failure if I give up made a huge difference. (Again, thank you so much Eli!)   
> Even if it wasn't 6am, I still did some decent stretches, showered, did a bit of journaling for a while and made some breakfast. The familiarity of it made me feel more composed overall. It's almost comforting in a way?
> 5. Improvement: I'd like to wake up early everyday regardless of whether I have classes or not. Apart from that, I'm really happy! I've got the habit working for me and I'm super excited about it. I'd like to move from 15 minute workouts to 20 minutes after a couple days. 
> 6. Tomorrow: I don't have class tomorrow either so I'm going to plan for a more laid-back morning and try to get out of bed by 7:00 instead of 6:00 and maybe 6:30 if I go to bed early. I'd like to exercise for 15 minutes and maybe even go for a walk sometime during the day if I can :D

> Hey Eli! Thank you so much for everything! I'm really going to miss typing out my plans for the day to tell you about it in the morning :(  
> When I started the program, my goals were to wake up at 5am every single day and exercise for around an hour like I used to before the pandemic. Looking back, those were pretty stupid goals, My aim right now is to exercise and eat clean so that I can be healthy. (Also plan for cheat days :D) Waking up early is still an aim and I've been waking up at 5:30 for the past few days so I'm closer to my goal than I thought. I didn't think I could make much progress in a week but I did and I can barely believe it. This is sounding really cheesy but it's true. 
> 
> I think the biggest part was the shift in mindset. It was less about the actual workouts and morning routines but more about the mental aspects of things, what was providing the resistance that made me want to sleep in instead of wake up and things like that. I have a different outlook on things, especially on failure.   
> I think the most insightful part of the program was when you told me that: *It's only considered failing if you give up.* Usually I'd give up if I woke up at 5:35 instead of 5:30 and use it as an excuse to call the entire day subpar.   
> 
> 
> Another difference I've noticed is with my mental health, I think I'm doing much better right now. Since I had more time in the morning to make breakfast before class, I felt way more energized and my mornings were significantly better. Those extra hours in the morning made a huge difference. I felt stuck between the person I used to be and the person I wanted to be. It was like I couldn't really budge but right now, I'm waking up early, working out everyday (even if it's only for 10 minutes), journaling, going to bed early, eating clean, and I'm just so much happier with myself than I thought possible. I actually don't hate myself anymore, I actually feel like I can do stuff. I can't thank you enough for that. Thank you Eli, I really mean it.

> 
> There was this one moment when I was going to bed and I realized that my day had been pretty much *perfect.* I'd always imagined amazing days where a future better version of me (with amazing habits and routines) got a lot of shit done and went to bed feeling great.

> 
> The future is scary 0\_0. I don't think I have an exact idea of where I want to go but I do have a general direction. I'd like to keep up with the exercise, I bought myself resistance bands yesterday! Exercising is much more fun when I take it less seriously and do it for myself. :D

> With waking up, I'd like to push to 5am from 5:30am. Right now my morning routine is mostly just <shower-journal-make breakfast> but I'd like to add studying in as well. Another thing that you said that just really stuck- sometimes you don't need to improve anything else, you can just revel in your success  for once. (I probably paraphrased it horribly, I'm sorry)
