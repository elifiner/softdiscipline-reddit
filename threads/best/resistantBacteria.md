> Nice! Play around with the time you do it to find the best fit, and maybe try to tie it to some other activity instead of a specific time - before/after dinner, just before bed, etc. Your reminder could be a Postit note wherever that activity happens.

> Now I want to build another habit of maintaining my calendar. I don't have any plan for it. I tend to forget to adding tasks there. Not sure how to solve that one.

> I love it when someone's habit is so we'll established they are already looking for the next thing. Good on you!
> 
> If you want better grasp of your calendar and tasks, a good habit to form is a dialy review of both. Your plan would be e.g. to review your calendar and task list before bed for 5 minutes.
> 
> As usual, you start there and adjust as needed. And you're welcome to use the next cohort to give you some structure to do this through.
