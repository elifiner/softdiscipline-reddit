> Hey there, I’m not who you asked originally but just wanted to chime in that it takes me between 15-35 minutes to burn 200 calories, but really depends on the type of workout I’m doing. I mix a lot of HIIT with gentler workouts, but I looked back through my Apple Watch data to see what my average usually is. Hope that’s helpful!

> Hey! You’re awesome, thank you for doing this! It’s currently afternoon here so I’m just seeing this now, but hopefully I can be part of this cohort since it would be awesome to get this started tomorrow (Monday).
> 
> It’s hard to narrow down a habit that I’d like to work on for the next week because, like so many of us, there are so many things I’d like to work on and I’m an all or nothing kind of person. I find that I seem to go through phases of consistency (perhaps ADHD related, not sure) with habits I’m working on, such as working out, morning pages, no phone before bed, regular yoga, etc. 
> 
> I do know that I am capable of change because I went from being a heavy drinker to being sober for over a year now, so I do think that change is possible for me if I don’t get in my own way. 
> 
> All that to say, for the next seven days I’d like to really focus on two things: getting up early (thus setting myself up for a successful day with other habits I’m working on), and studying/working on career things for a couple hours every day. I have so much content to work on if I want to make a career change and I haven’t self-studied since early JULY!!!!!!!!! So anyways, thank you in advance and I’m really looking forward to this.

> 1. My habit is waking up earlier and studying for an hour or two every day — working towards a career change (ideally will study for longer but starting small).

> 2. I was able to reach my goals today! Planning on doing the same tomorrow, hopefully will be getting up even earlier.
> 
> 3. Planning to study in the morning! 
> 
> 4. I will remember by waking up and studying first thing, followed by working out.
> 
> 5. Sleeping in would stop me from doing it, however I have a meeting very early in the morning which will make me have to get up early. 
> 
> 6. Ideally I’d be able to view my goal every day as a meeting I can’t miss, also! I want to continue to go to bed at an earlier time so I can stick to studying and working out by noon every day.

> - wake up early

> 1. I’m working on waking up earlier and studying every day!

> 2. My plan was to try to push through after my early meeting this morning and try to study and then work out, or vice versa.

> 3. I woke up extremely early for my meeting and then…accidentally went back to bed. HOWEVER, I did get in 45 minutes of solid studying later in the day and that made my heart soar!!!!
> 
> 4. I did feel resistance, and absolutely almost completely skipped studying because I didn’t make it to the gym so thought it was a wash. Landed on the idea that something small was better than nothing, and I think that 45 minutes I did was really great and focused and inspired me to hopefully hit the same goals, or better, tomorrow. I’m also happy that although I didn’t go to the gym, I did listen to my body and do some light movement today instead.
> 
> 5. I can improve by attempting to do the same as today, which is adjusting a bit and allowing myself to do less than the lofty goals I set for myself. Less is more sometimes!!!!
> 
> 6. My plan for tomorrow is to hit an hour of studying — ideally more but an hour is achievable if I hit the hay soon! Again, would like to have studied and worked out by noon in my ideal world.

> 
> 4. I felt resistance when I was about to work out. Was looking for any reason not to, quite frankly. But I kept moving until I made it to the gym. 
> 
> 5. Only way to improve is to try to wake up earlier, but it’s a bit challenging at the moment because of my housing situation.

> That's beautiful, just the kid of update I like to hear on day 5. The daily check in will still ask you what you can improve about your plan but it doesn't sound like there's anything you need to do. Just keep it up and pay attention to any dependency you have on these check ins. If you need another system of reminders or accountability, now is a good time to set it up.

<sub>*2021-10-02 16:38*</sub>

I almost bailed because thought I didn’t have enough time but this week has helped me realize I don’t need to live in extremes, I can work on something for 15-30 minutes, it doesn’t have to be hours upon hours.

<sub>*2021-10-03 21:46*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Excellent work! I think falling off for a bit is completely natural, but it's easy to restart if you are able to forgive yourself and start slowly again.
> 
> At some point restarting just become apart of your flexible habit and you don't notice it as a separate thing anymore.
> 
> I'm playing around with building a follow-up program to this one that deals with restarting. It would basically be a weekly check-in to see if you need a restart and then if you do, a shorter version of this program to get back into it.

> Hey there! 
> 
> 1. I set out to get up earlier and study for an hour every day. I was not getting up early at all and spent the day to day thinking about how I wasn’t making any action towards my goal(s).
> 
> 2. I surprised and delighted myself with my ability to actually get up early and put in focused work daily. Before, I couldn’t really wrap my mind around the idea of being flexible. I’m not saying I’m 100% on it now, but I’ve made incredible progress IMO.
> 
> 3. This process helped me because you gave me the accountability needed to push myself to do it again the next day. I loved seeing the gains on a day to day basis! There was a moment a few days ago when it really clicked that I could adjust things for the day as needed and that I needed to go with the flow a bit (schedule is a bit all over the place at the moment) and adapt. I understand, logically, that I can’t do an hour plus of studying every day! But, when I couldn’t, I still put in time — such as yesterday I did less than 20 minutes, but I also was way further in my studies for the week than anticipated and gave myself permission to have a chiller one. Put in a killer workout, wrote, and meditated as well, which are all things I’m trying to implement on a daily basis.
> 
> Also, staring the obvious but it really sunk in last week how important the morning hours are. When I get up later, the rest of the world is up too and the distractions stack up. However, my sleep is down significantly from getting up earlier — like 1.5 hours+ a night (I wear a fitness tracker so I have the data) so I obviously need to make a concerted effort to go to sleep earlier.
> 
> 4. That’s a great question. Right now, I’m studying to reach a goal. Ideally within 6 months I’ll have reached that goal which will open up my morning to spend more time on the other things I’m trying to implement consistently (meditating, writing, reading). For now, I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing, focusing on putting in an hour+ of studying at least 5 days a week, more when I can, while working on my other goals in manageable increments, ideally.
