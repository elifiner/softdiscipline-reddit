> 1. Exercise
> 2. 1 cardio session and 15 min arms exercise 
> 3. Between 7-9pm local time
> 4. Set a reminder for it
> 5. Major obstacles are tasks on the work getting extended and tiredness after long work hours
> 6. Start as early as possible .If I keep the workout hours close to dinner , I feel lazy and tired and hungry and tend to lose my motivation. I could also eat something before exercising to keep my energy up.

> Eating something before exercise soids useful. And I'd also aim lower to start with 15 minutes total. You should be able to do this regardless bof how tired you are. You can go even lower if that feels too much.

> Consistency before intensity :)

> 1. Exercising
> 2. 1 cardio session + 15 mins arms exercise
> 3. DIDN'T go as planned :(
> 4. Work has been piling up on me since past couple of weeks. One task got extended so spent the time I blocked for exercise there.
> 5. Could have completed work in evening instead wasted time there. Also, exercising as soon as possible in evening is a better choice I think.
> 6. Honestly work is still not over , huge tasks are in my backlog but plan for tomorrow is to do it at 5-6 pm local time , 2 hours before original plan.

> Your daily plan didn't work out, but the overall plan is still on track. The first attempt to plan and execute a habit often doesn't work out. Let's adjust.
> 
> See if you can reduce your exercise routine even further: a basic warmup, 10 pushups, 10 squats and 30 second plank or similar takes under 5 minutes, regardless of how busy you are and it will help you to start get into the habit of exercising.

> 1. Exercising 
> 2. Exercise 6-7pm 
> 3. Unexpected work meeting got extended till 9:30
> 4. I honestly wanted to leave the fuckin meeting and go to exercise. But when I got off the meeting , I was so tired that I couldn't pull off even a 20 min session
> 5. I will block my calendar for exercise from 6-7pm everyday so that no meetings get scheduled at that time
> 6. Will have a larger 60-120 min session tomorrow to make up for the missed days.

> The best thing about this is how much you wanted to leave the meeting for your workout. That's your habit kicking in. You might not be able to do it everyday, but if you want to do it everyday it's going to keep you going even if you slip it occasionally.

> 1.Exercise
> 2. Exercise for atleast an hour in the evening
> 3. I did exercise for an hour ( yay !!)
> 4. I was so sad for missing the previous day that I felt no resistance whatsover today.
> 5. I would say the improvement area is that I have to be consistent, even if it's not a longer session maybe just one 15-20 min session but I should try to do it everyday. 
> 6. I have some prior commitments tomorrow but I am gonna sure I squeeze in atleast a 20 min run somehow.

> Also, thanks for doing this dude ! Really appreciate the effort you put in everyday to check-in on our habits. You for sure are impacting a lot of lives !

> Well thank you! It absolutely helps to build a daily exercise habit. Even if you sometimes skip it because your body is too sore or you just don't have a moment to spare, you still have a mindset of daily exercise and that just keeps you going.

> My phone broke down a week back and I know it's super late but I wanted to share it anyway.  
> 1. I started with a basic goal of exercising everyday
> 2. Well the current state is that I don't necessarily do it everyday but I try to not skip if it's possible to have a session.
> 3. I have learnt 2 important things during this 7 day program that we did - First I need to sleep properly because if that doesn't happen , I feel tired all day and motivation to work out goes to the bin. Second- I need to do it early . The more I push it to late hours , less likely I am going to do it.
> 4. In terms of future, I think if I follow the ones I mentioned in #3 and have small accomplishable goals like losing 1-2 kgs per month, then I am all set.

> Again , thanks u/zoozla for doing this

> That sounds awesome, and those are some great conclusions!
> 
> The only thing I'd add is to not focus too much on the kg lost, but more on the process itself - your exercise, your diet and your lifestyle. The better you get with those the better your progress with weight loss will be, but focusing on the weight as a goal can be a bit demoralizing as it tends to fluctuate quite a bit.
