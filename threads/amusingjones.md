> The habit I would like to build is completing homework assignments on time. I'm a musical theatre major in my first year in the program, which is at a university. For the past two months I was able to make due with my grades based on the sheer adrenaline and 'newness' of my situation. After all, I'm out on my own now in a new place and it's exciting! However, the past 3 weeks I've been struggling, as the sense of newness has been replaced by a certain amount of dread. Basically, my brain has registered that this is going to be a lot of work (which I knew going into it, but it hits hard). And also I really care about what I'm doing here... which means there is a greater risk involved with actually doing the work. I'm passionate about acting, I spent years building up a resume/portfolio so I could audition and get in to a fancy school like this, I've spent A LOT of money to be here, and this training is in theory going to set me up for a professional career. So when I say greater risk... I mean that every time I start an assignment I'm thinking, at least implicitly... "This is my life's purpose and the start of my career. I have to make this assignment stellar, otherwise I'm not setting myself up for success." Ironically, this is what stops me from starting the work. And then I put it off, and then the due date passes and I have to make excuses as to why my creative projects aren't done. It's no bueno. It also becomes a viscous cycle, because the more I realize I'm falling behind, the more I beat myself up about it and feel like crap. And that's not ideal when trying to start a habit or change something.

> My history with homework troubles is long and arduous. I've always been very intelligent objectively. But I've struggled with school from 7th grade up to college (now) simply because of my inability to consistently do homework. A major part of it has always been perfectionism. I want to do really well and live up to my own high expectations. But the fear of failure leads to discomfort and, ultimately, avoidance of the behavior that causes that response (homework). Since the beginning of high school, those viscous cycles I mentioned have been fairly common as well. It feels like just a hole that's growing exponentially bigger. 
> 
> During this time (especially in the past 3 years) I have tried a variety of strategies to try and cope and get the work done. Here are the four major ones.
> 
> **1) Pomodoro timers, with rewards for completion.** This one was the first that I tried. It was an attempt to help with my time management, make the work periods feel less daunting (only 20 minutes!), and to give myself a boost of motivational energy from the craving of the reward. I've been trying this one for three years. I do find it helpful sometimes. However it never seems to solve my problem. I think the issue is that even when I have shorter study periods, my brain still picks up on the looming threat of failure and the fear that comes with actually *finishing* the assignment. Also I find it hard to restrain myself from taking the selgf imposed rewards before I'm even finished (when my willpower is a little weaker). 
> 
> **2) Prioritization list of all my current assignments.** This one never really works. I get overwhelmed. Even when I just take it one at a time, I'm overwhelmed and frustrated. Especially if I'm behind assignments at all. Because then I have like double the list amount to look at.
> 
> **3) Rational Self Talk and CBT thought restructuring.** I learned these strategies over years in therapy. They are incredibly helpful for in the moment anxiety, stress, and sadness in every aspect of my life. And I love that they are evidence based and extensively researched methods (even though everyone's got their own helpful things of course) They absolutely help with the difficult thoughts and feelings that arise when I start homework. I calm down and feel happier. The issue seems to be that, even when I am thinking more clearly... I don't actually have the habit to **DO** the homework. It's not engrained in my muscle or procedural memory. And even when clear headed, I have strong resistance to just working away. 
> 
> **4) Behavior Experiments.** I learned this the most recently in some productivity books and in therapy. For me, this strategy purely targets perfectionism. For example, I'm afraid if i don't do my best work on an assignment, I'll receive a failing grade. And that might add up to a bad grade in the course. Okay, great I've identified that. Now I'm gonna 'half ass' this one particular assignment (perhaps it's a small one at first) by MY standards. And the result I'm curious about is... does that feared outcome acyually happen? Do I fail the assignment? Or do I receive more like a B... or even an A! How did I do in the class? It's all about a curious attitude. Good results equal changes in beliefs and positive reinforcement of the new beliefs. This is wonderful, and I thought this strategy was the game changer. However, similar to the last one... it only works when I can bring myself to **DO** the assignment (especially on time). And doing it just feels so difficult that I'm not able to employ this strategy often enough.

> There ya go! Hopefully that answers all of the guidelines. Thanks for the offer of help and support to us! (Idk if I'm supposed to put when I wrote this but it is currently early early morning on Wednesday 10/27 for me).

> Wow, you've done a hell of a lot of work on this and there's a lot on the line for you here.
> 
> Given the amount of time you put into this already  and what you know about yourself, you might need more than a 7 day boost to get you to the next level.
> 
> There's a deeper program I can offer you that will get you to a point where you can consistently put in the effort you need. I can't promise your perfectionism will disappear (and maybe it shouldn't in your line of work), but I *can* promise your sense of resistance will lessen substantially, and that you *will* get into the habit of doing your homework every day.
> 
> This program is a month long and it's a paid engagement, but given what's on the line for you it might be worth the cost and effort.

> 1//Complete Homework consistently 2//Complete Reading Reflections #2 and #3 for acting class (from the urgent and important task list) 3//Start today at 3:15 pm 4// Since it’s so close to the time I want to start, I’m going to write down my goal clearly on a blank piece of paper and just have it in front of me. Im also going to have my mom check in on me with a phone call at 4:15 pm as an accountability reminder. 5//The fear that I’m going to be forced to drop out of this school at some point is going to come up. I often respond to this by retreating inward, and I start to feel exhausted and abandon my homework. I then switch locations and do it all over again… (ie. I go to the library,the park, etc.) it’s an unhelpful habit 6// I’m just gonna see what happens when I stay in my dorm for a few hours while working, and don’t give in to the painful inner experiences. Hopefully it will help inform me for the coming days even.

> So here’s the plan:
> 1 - Complete homework consistently 
> 2 - Start with Reflections #2 and #3 (acting)
> 3 - Start at 3:15 pm
> 4 - Write down goal and have mom call to check in
> 5 - OBSTACLE: Fear of flunking out leads to escape of the work and the location I’m in.
> 6 - WORKAROUND: see what happens when I don’t leave my dorm and stay present to my experiences.

> We're going to be doing more work on this in our one-on-one, but I think you should focus on this inner negative experience.
> 
> When it comes up tomorrow, stop don't Ng your homework and just sit down to write - what you're feeling, what you're thinking, what you imagine will happen. Don't analyze yourself too much (I think you might be prone to that), just let it flow out of you.
> 
> And if you don't do any homework after that, it's OK. You need to work with your fear, not against it here, and the first thing is to get to know it intimately.
