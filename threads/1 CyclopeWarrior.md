> Make sure you have a separate notebook to write down those failure thoughts. Every time it comes up, write it down, that should at least keep it from looping endlessly in your head. You can post them as part of you check-in too, I'll try to help you with a different perspective on things.

> Got a marvelous wake up time naturally at 6:30 am even when the alarm was at 8, so got up and ready to start at the time, did 2 sets of 35 minutes with a 10 minute break to clean my apartment a bit, then had a meeting till lunchtime. Now it's nap time (it's hot here) and after finishing other duties it's time to try 1 or 2 more sets of study time.

> 4. Did you feel any resistance?
> It's tiring of course, reworking disorganized notes into order. It will be much easier once I get on track and have my better notes up. Still got distracted at times, gotta keep still more.
> 
> 5. What can you adjust about your plan to make it even easier to do?
> Reduce distractions, try and focus more, and do more sets of study in a row with breaks in between till i can manage several hours. Taking notes of things to look up later on YouTube explanations is def on my mind too, to better consolidate what i read.

The 30 minutes you did today is a phenomenal achievement - your habit is consistent! You're definitely not falling from any horse I can see.

> Now you need to figure out how to increase your study time without burning out. I don't know enough about your situation to offer specific advice but if you tell me what keeps you busy I might be able to see something you don't.

<sub>*2021-09-25 02:06*</sub>
**CyclopeWarrior**
> What keeps me busy? Well myself really. Today i had to take care of getting some gas cylinders in the morning, and since i for some reason woke up at 3 am with my energy full i started cleaning my apartment and organizing things around. Think i could have studied at that time no problem. By midday i had to cook for the family and after lunch i just had to take a rest before the rest of the day. So yeah i find it less a case of me being actually busy and more me just *trying to get myself* busy.

<sub>*2021-09-25 02:11*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Yeah, that does sound like a kind of busy you could work around. Hmm.. so what's up with waking up at 3am? Is that a common thing for you? Do you have any sense of what you're trying to avoid or run away from? Keeping yourself busy kinda sounds like you might be.

> Could you spend some time exploring this in writing? I won't be able to reply for a few hours and I'd like to help you figure this out. There are some patterns here to how your sleep, how you eat, how your thoughts and emotions work, how your relationships and commitments work, and how your priorities work that creates this sense of busyness.

Even 5 minutes will start to get you into the daily habit. A lot do this is about vhsning your state of mind. The actual change in your body will come when your habit is firmly established.
