> I do really well with in-person classes. I bombed at online school back in \~2015, so I was dreading the transition to online classes due to COVID. It's been going okay, my marks are fine, but there's a lot of falling behind, getting really anxious, cramming, and then repeating the cycle. Super over it - it's not sustainable for my mental health nor my ability to retain what I'm learning.

> Honestly, I've tried to stick to the schedule for a while now. It doesn't seem to happen. It's been since August-ish, because we switched to synchronous sessions. I try to pre-vise my work ahead of the scheduled synchronous sessions, but the sense of urgency and motivation is absent. I've tried several planner systems but my stumbling block is definitely implementation. I love what I'm studying, but the current mode of teaching doesn't mesh well with being ADHD as fuck. I thrive on the physical structures that hold me accountable, but I can't really put that responsibility on my (unpaid) partner/friends/family.

> For one, the scheduled synchronous sessions tend to be around 8-10am. I am useless at that time, despite getting up around 6am. I hit my stride around 1-2pm. The other factor is just struggling to work through my lectures on my own without getting distracted or otherwise self-sabotaging.

Time has a way of escaping me - or rather, I have a way of escaping my regularly scheduled sense of time!

> Hey cap! Don't worry about the delay at all. We're all all over the world and in different timezones so a day's delay is expected.

> It sounds like just building a daily habit of doing some studying would do you a world of good. You can stack focusing on the most important things to study later, but we need to build some consistency first.

> Ah, balls. I see today's thread (21/10) is posted already, but this post pertains to today, so I'm going to update here this am and give my feedback on the day on the day 2 thread this evening, if that's okay.

> >What's your habit?
> 
> Working/studying consistently with my university timetable. 
> 
> >What are you planning to do tomorrow?
> 
> Just that! I have four things scheduled - a synchronous language tutorial, two synchronous lectures, and one asynchronous lecture. I've done the work for my 8am, so I'm skipping that, but I'll be following the timetable for the rest of them.

> >When are you planning to do it?

> Do the pre-vising for my 10am lecture from 9-10, and will block in time to do the rest of the work through the rest of the day.

> >What can keep you from doing it?

> I usually miss an early lecture because it doesn't line up with my early time, then throw the whole day away because "I already missed one thing". So, I guess, an all-or-nothing mindset gets in the way.

> As for the to-do list, I get sidetracked and stop looking at the list - so, I guess, my own laziness/lack of follow-through can get in the way. 
> 
> >How can you work around that?
> 
> Today, I'm consciously skipping the early lecture since I planned ahead and did that work already. It's intentional, and not a cue for me to abandon ship. I'm going to try and work *with* my circadian rhythms and not against them. 
> 
> With the list - usually I make my to-do list on my iPad, but then I just don't look at the document. So, I'll do it on paper today and leave it on the table so I can't just pretend it doesn't exist.

> Your biggest battle is against this "I already missed one thing" thought. And the simplest remedy is a "So what?" thought. So what if you missed one thing? So what if you didn't do what you planned?

> Hello! It’s been going really well, actually, so I tried to roll with the productivity and pack in enough work that I could actually take my Friday night and Saturday off to spend with my family and partner - they’ve been getting the stressy version of me for a couple weeks now and it was really rewarding to be able to completely focus on them instead of having half a mind on work. 
> 
> 1. I’ve been working on keeping fairly consistent with following my timetable and not grabbing a fuck-it bucket when I miss one or two things. 
> 
> 2. I made my to-do list, incorporating breaks and future work I needed to pre-vise. 
> 
> 3. For the most part, it was pretty easy to stick to the plan. I did find that my time blindness had me underestimating how long particular activities would take, so I have learned that I need to block in two or three three planning sessions a day to be able to accommodate that. 
> 
> 4. I did plan to work through Saturday as well, but that morning I just wasn’t feeling it. I had a health issue and decided I could afford to take it easy for the day instead of forcing it and ending up burning out (and hence setting up a fuckit bucket moment for next week). It was really nice to be able to gift myself some relaxation!
> 
> 5. I would like to incorporate slightly more long-term planning for upcoming exams and so on. It’s really a challenge for me to have a structured week instead of just a day, so I’m kind of brainstorming how I can overcome resistance there.  One of the issues is the time blindness - when it becomes a rolling list of what I didn’t do on one specific day that then gets added to the next, I get overwhelmed and feel like I can’t catch up. 
> 
> One thing I’ve been considering is just having a weekly list with an approximate time estimate, excluding the synchronous sessions scheduled by the university, that becomes my activity bank for the day. So I have a firm “things I must attend” list for each weekday, and a “things I must complete in my own time” list that fills up the rest of the day. It’s Sunday now, so I think I can set it up today and give it a trial run on Monday.

> That sounds wonderful! I don't think there's anything to add except for the fact that a task list isn't something to compley, it's just something to prioritize out of. There are always more things on it than you can possibly do and that's the correct and healthy state of it.
> 
> Your focus on long and short term planning and prioritization should help you tackle that.
