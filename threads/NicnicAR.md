> Why don't you *plan* to wake up 9 hours after you go to sleep? That way you can sleep in and still follow your plan to study. Different people need different amounts of sleep at different times. Fighting your body isn't very sustainable.

> If you're taking medications that are screwing with your sleep it's going to be hard to stick to a sleep schedule. Any plan you make will need to take that into consideration.

> As for Python, I get the sense you're missing some fundamentals and are trying to quickly jump ahead. That can get very frustrating quickly. If you're looking to switch careers, maybe you can look at Lambda School. They provide excellent education for free and you only pay them back when you get a job. It's quite a commitment though :)

> I talked this with two friends (one learned by himself and the other went to college) both told me that nobody can "sprint" tackle the programming career so easly, if you want to be a good programmer you need to spend time on it, and I'm a disaster about that (that is why this cohort really helped me to think about myself).

<sub>*2021-10-25 20:39*</sub>
**zoozla**
> Yep. The https://lambdaschool.com/ program I mentioned has two plans if I remember correctly - a full time 6 months and a part time 2 years. Much shorter than a full college program but it's still a lot of effort and commitment.
> 
> Also, consider than if you were 50 years old right now and decided to spend 2 years learning programming, you'd have 8 years of post-studies experience by the time you're 60, with still 15-20 active years to push even further. You sound younger, so your math is even more favorable.
