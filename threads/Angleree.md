> Hello!
> I'd like to build a habit of studying everyday, even if it's just for a few minutes. I've always had trouble staying motivated and concentrated on tasks. I'm a final yr med student and I've finished my final exams, so I feel like I have no motivation to study. When I return home from placements I end up just napping and watching Netflix/ binge social media.

> You sound exhausted. Let's work on your studying habit and maybe a more effective wwy for you to unwind after a long day.
> 
> I'll post an invitation to make a daily plan in a bit and we'll get started.

> I don't know if 30 minutes is a lot of a little for you but notice any resistance or friction you feel while doing it. It's possible you may need to start with a lower goal.

> It's not just distraction, it's priorities too. You'll probab need to schedule your studies to happen first thing in the morning (even before brushing your teeth) to make sure it happens. I'd even go as far as putting your notebooks by your bed and you phone far away :)
> 
> I agree that trimming it down to 15 minutes should help as well.

> 1. Study everyday
> 2. Go through 15 min medications review 
> 3. Managed to do 5 minutes
> 4.An event in my personal life sent me into abit of a mental spiral. Resorted back to playing games with friends as an unproductive coping mechanism.  Not prioritising studying 
> 5. Work on studying first thing in the morning, being able to separate my emotions from my work
> 6. 10 minutes of medications review

> Your emotions aren't something you need to ignore and push through, but something to attend to, especially if they are in the way of your studies.
> 
> I don't know what happened, but sounds like it's dramatic enough gh to warrant some attention. A couple of things can help:
> 
> 1. Writing or journalling is usually helpful to process things.
> 
> 2. The Wuju app can help process your difficult emotions. You can try it at https://stress.wuju.app (disclosure: I'm the author of the app).
> 
> 3. If this is really throwing you off, talking to a pro might help to work through that.
